# Docker Playground: Beginner Projects (All-in-One)

Repository to implement **all** the ideas/practices from this article:
- https://www.kdnuggets.com/5-fun-docker-projects-for-absolute-beginners

The goal is to have an organized, reproducible, and easy-to-run “playground”, where each mini-project is isolated and documented.
